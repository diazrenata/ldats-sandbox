Sandbox for messing with MATSS-LDATS stuff without interfering with the main cache

See https://github.com/weecology/MATSS-LDATS/issues/44 for a history of the overall likelihood problem and why we are taking a leave-one-out crossvalidation approach.

This repo is for developing the leave one out method without drastically changing the MATSS-LDATS infrastructure and cache.
